Problem description:
====================

The ARTMAP letters network shows the supervised classification of
input patterns by an ARTMAP network. The ARTMAP network consits of two
ART1 networks combined by a MAP-field. The input patterns are similar
to the patterns of the 'letters' pattern file, except that these
patterns are in 'complement coding' notation, i.e. there exists an
original 5x7 input matrix representing capital letters and its
inverse, combined into (5*7)+(5*7) = 70-dimensional vector.  The
desired output is coded by the last 5 elements of each input pattern,
giving a 75-dimensional input pattern alltogether.  (for
implementation reasons this desired output is given here as an
additional component of the input).

See the SNNS user manual for a more detailed description of the ARTMAP
implementation in SNNS.


Pattern-Files:	artmap.pat
==============

The pattern-file letters.pat contains 26 binary input patterns with values
of 0 and 1 representing capital letters in a 5x7 input matrix.


Network-Files:	artmap.net
==============

This network file contains a trained ARTMAP network for the letter
classification task described above. The standard configuration file
for this network is artmap.cfg (one 2D display only).

You may generate your own ARTMAP network with the BIGNET tool from the
Info-Panel of SNNS. This automatically generates all units and the
necessary connections.

Because the unit types and link structure are highly specialized in
ARTMAP we strongly urge you only to use this tool to generate ARTMAP
networks in SNNS.

Hints:
======

Read the chapter about ARTMAP in the SNNS manual very carefully!

Note that ARTMAP needs a special network initialization function 
	(REMOTE panel: OPTIONS select init function: ARTMAP_Weights).
Note that there exist two different ARTMAP update functions: 
	(REMOTE panel: OPTIONS select update function: ARTMAP_Synchronous
						or     ARTMAP_Stable)
Note that ARTMAP needs a special learning function:
	(REMOTE panel: OPTIONS select learning function: ARTMAP)
These should already be set when loading the example ARTMAP network.
